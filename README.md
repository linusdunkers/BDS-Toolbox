# BDS Toolbox

**BDS Toolbox** is a WordPress plugin designed to promote awareness and support for the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement. The plugin filters visitors based on GeoIP location and provides tools to share information about the movement, helping site owners advocate for peace and human rights.

## Features
- **GeoIP Filtering**: Detect visitors' geographical location and customize their experience accordingly.
- **Custom Content**: Display default or custom HTML content for visitors from specific regions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily configure settings via the WordPress admin dashboard.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Optimized for performance without impacting site speed.

## Installation
1. **Upload the Plugin**:  
   - Download the latest release of the plugin.  
   - Upload the `BDS-Toolbox` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
2. **Activate the Plugin**:  
   - Navigate to the WordPress admin dashboard.  
   - Go to the "Plugins" section and activate **BDS Toolbox**.
3. **Configure Settings**:  
   - Navigate to **Settings > BDS Toolbox** to customize displayed content or adjust GeoIP settings.

## How It Works
The plugin uses a GeoIP database to determine the visitor's location. Visitors from specific countries (e.g., Israel) are shown tailored content, such as messages advocating for the BDS movement or promoting human rights campaigns.
