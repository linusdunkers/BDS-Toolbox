Filters visitors based on their geographical IP and shares BDS movement resources to promote peace and human rights.

== Description ==

**BDS Toolbox** is a WordPress plugin designed to support the global effort to promote human rights and justice by working alongside the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. The plugin provides tools to share critical information, raise awareness, and engage with the movement’s call to end ongoing human rights violations.

**Features of BDS Toolbox:**
- **GeoIP Filtering:** Identifies visitors based on geographical IP and displays targeted information.
- **Customizable Content:** Admins can replace the default BDS message with personalized HTML content via the WordPress dashboard.
- **Awareness and Advocacy:** Display messages encouraging peaceful solutions, promoting ceasefire, and ending documented human rights violations.
- **Planned Features:** Future updates will include news feeds, educational resources, and tools for mobilizing support for human rights campaigns.

**Why BDS Toolbox?**
The plugin is rooted in internationally recognized human rights principles. Following reports from organizations like Amnesty International, which concluded there is an ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, and the ICC's arrest warrants for Israeli officials over war crimes, the BDS movement continues to advocate for non-violent solutions. BDS Toolbox empowers websites to raise awareness about these efforts and provide actionable ways for individuals to support peace and justice.
